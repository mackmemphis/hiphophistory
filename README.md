From the beginning of African American Dance Music to The Birth of Hip Hop til now;  This is the History of Hip Hop

Hi.  I'm the founder of The Worldwide Hip Hop Hall of Fame Wax Museum Tourism and Hospitality Resort.  Also Known As WWHHHOFWM .  

I am making a few minor changes so that the idea flows right.  

Anyway here is a copy of a code that I wish to add to an app and build from there.  
The idea is to have sort of like a hip hop data base, any and everythng dealing with hip hop and every hip hop artist, thing etc.
